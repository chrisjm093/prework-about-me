      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am in the process of changing careers! I've been working in the Health Care field as a Respiratory Therapist for nine years and am excited to get into the field of Web Development!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Wisconsin</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy a broad spectrum of hobbies! I'm self taught on the Guitar as well as the ukulele, and banjo (I'm not very good but it's just for me). I also enjoy gaming and playing card games with my wife. When I venture outside I love hiking, camping, fishing, and really anything that gets me some fresh air.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>A dream job to me is one that doesn't feel like a job. A profession that gives me a sense of purpose and fulfillment. Ideally my dream job will not interfear with my home and family life, but enhance it. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live on the east side of Seattle, nestled at the foot of the Cascade mountains</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a Web Developer because I feel like I have something to contribute to the field. Working in Health Care has been rewarding, but it's time for me to pursue a career that is closer to my dream job. I believe Web Developement is condusive to that dream.</p>
